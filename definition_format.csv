Name,Type,Validator,Description
Path,path-string,.*,"Sample path, relative to the repo root. Directories end with '/'"
Normative,boolean,true|false,"Whether this is actually part of the standard, as is ('true'), or rather just a sample content, to clarify the use of the ancestor directories ('false')"
Tracked,boolean,true|false,"Whether this is part of the repo sources, e.g. git tracked ('true'), or rather untracked (e.g. generated) ('false')."
Generated,boolean,true|false,"Whether this record may be a directory containing generated files, or files being generated ('true'), or it is purely for files commonly used as sources (e.g. text-based) ('false'). Of course, we would prefer to prevent generated/binary files to be tracked altogether, but that is not very realistic for OSH documentation projects. This indicator may be useful to nudge designers to keep all their generated files under a single directory, to at least be able to put them in a git sub-module, which allows to improve performance over time, if required."
Module,boolean,true|false,"Whether this is a directory containing a module (== a part that might be used elsewhere/is its own proper project) ('true'), or not ('false')"
ArbitraryContent,Option(boolean),true|false|-,"Whether this directory may contain arbitrary other directories ('true'), or has a certain, predefined set of directory names that may be used ('false'), or is not a directory ('-')"
Tags,options-string,.*,"A '|' separated list of tags that apply to the record. Currently commonly used are ""bom"" (indicating Bill-of-Material files) and ""license"" (indicating license files)."
Indicativeness,"float [0.0, 1.0]",0.[0-9]+|1.0,"How likely this entry indicates that a project containing it, is actually using this very dir standard, with a value from min 0.0 to max 1.0. This is used to try to automatically figure out, which standard a project is using, looking at its dir and file structure."
Variations,options-string,.*,A '|' separated list of names for the last path part if it is a directory; empty for files
Regex,regex-string,.*,"A Regex expression, always matching the whole repo-relative path, to indicate this entry"
Description,string,.*,Description of this entry; human-readable
Sample Content,string|URL,.*,"Either an HTTP(S) URL to download a sample content, or the sample content itsself. Which of the two it is, can be figured out by checking if the first four chars equal to 'http'"
